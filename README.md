****Obstacle Detection and Collision Avoidance****





**Abstract**

In this paper, we designed and implemented an intelligent obstacle detection
system on Quadcopter.This task is a subset of both “Obstacle detection” and “object
Following” problems in computer vision. In a populated area(objects and infinite
obstacles),following a specific object without any collision taking place, needs the
system to be able to predict the obstacles and collisions as soon as possible.In
application,in finding the injured or missing individuals during natural
disasters,UAVs need to avoid collisions.Moreover,for mapping in civil
engineering,or in dejsigning Autonomous cars’s collision Avoidance systems,as well
as we can build safe systems for guinding the blind people, or children.


Keywords: Quadcopter, Object Following,Guidance,Obstacle Detection,Collision
Avoidance.
